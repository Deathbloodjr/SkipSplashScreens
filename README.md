# SkipSplashScreens
| Mono | IL2CPP |

This is a mod for Taiko no Tatsujin: The Drum Master!\
This mod will pass through all the splash screens very quickly.\
This is very similar to a mod included in TakoTako. However, that mod creates a minor bug that prevents a few assets from being initialized on each first play.\
This mod uses a different method to pass the splash screens, and avoids creating that bug.\
I would not mind if this mod replaces the mod in TakoTako.\

It has support for Mono (1.2.2) and IL2CPP (1.3.0+) versions of the game.
